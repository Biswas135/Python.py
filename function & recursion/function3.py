# built-in function example:

print("apnacollege", end="$")   # end="$" means the line will end with $ instead of a new line
# sep="" is used when printing multiple items, but here you have only one, so it's not used

print("shradhakhapra")          # end defaults to "\n", so it prints on the next line
